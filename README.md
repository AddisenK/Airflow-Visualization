# Airflow Visualization - Aircraft Aerodynamics

A modern, interactive 3D web application that visualizes airflow (air particles and streamlines) around an aircraft during different stages of flight. Built with React, TypeScript, Three.js, and a futuristic UI.

## ✈️ Features

### Core Functionality

- **3D Airflow Visualization**
  - Real-time particle system showing airflow around aircraft components (nose, wings, fuselage, tail)
  - GPU-accelerated particle rendering with custom shaders
  - Color-coded particles (blue to red gradient) based on velocity
  - Dynamic particle density and velocity adjustments

- **Flight Stages**
  - **Taxi**: Low speed, minimal airflow
  - **Takeoff**: High angle of attack, increased particle density
  - **Climb**: Moderate speed, upward trajectory
  - **Cruise**: Maximum speed, optimal airflow
  - **Descent**: Negative angle of attack, reduced speed
  - **Landing**: Low speed, high angle of attack

- **Multiple Camera Angles**
  - **Front View**: Nose-on perspective
  - **Rear View**: Wake and turbulence visualization
  - **Wing View**: Side profile
  - **Top-Down View**: Overhead perspective
  - **Free Orbit**: Mouse-controlled camera (drag to rotate, scroll to zoom)

- **Interactive Controls**
  - Airspeed slider (0-600 knots)
  - Angle of attack slider (-20° to +20°)
  - Wind strength control (0-100%)
  - Particle density adjustment (0-100%)
  - Toggle overlays:
    - Lift vectors (green arrows showing upward force)
    - Pressure zones (red/blue regions above/below wings)
    - Turbulence visualization

### UI/UX

- **Modern Futuristic Design**
  - Dark theme with aviation-inspired color palette
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
  - Responsive layout
  - Minimalist, Apple-like interface

   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in terminal)

### 🚀 Quick Deploy to Vercel

**No local installation needed!** Just push to GitHub and Vercel will handle everything:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the repository in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "Deploy" - that's it!

Vercel will automatically:
- Install dependencies
- Build the project
- Deploy it live

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory. You can preview the production build with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Airflow Simulation

The application uses a simplified aerodynamic model that emphasizes visual clarity over scientific precision:

1. **Particle System**
   - 5,000 particles are continuously generated in front of the aircraft
   - Each particle follows a simplified physics model:
     - Base velocity towards the aircraft (based on airspeed)
     - Wind effects (lateral and vertical disturbances)
     - Angle of attack influence (vertical deflection)
     - Turbulence around wing surfaces (randomized motion)

2. **Aerodynamic Effects**
   - **Lift Vectors**: Visual representation of upward force generated by wings
   - **Pressure Zones**: Simplified visualization of high (red) and low (blue) pressure regions
   - **Turbulence**: Enhanced particle randomization near wing surfaces

3. **Flight Stage Parameters**
   Each flight stage modifies:
   - Airspeed (knots)
   - Angle of attack (degrees)
   - Wind strength (0-1)
   - Particle density (0-1)
   - Particle velocity multiplier (0-1)

### Technical Implementation

- **React Three Fiber**: React renderer for Three.js, providing declarative 3D scene management
- **Custom Shaders**: GPU-accelerated particle rendering with vertex and fragment shaders
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for flight parameters and UI state
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for modern styling

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Select a Flight Stage**: Click one of the flight stage buttons (Taxi, Takeoff, Climb, Cruise, Descent, Landing)
2. **Change Camera View**: Use the camera view buttons to switch perspectives
3. **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sliders to fine-tune:
   - Airspeed
   - Angle of attack
   - Wind strength
   - Particle density
4. **Toggle Overlays**: Enable/disable lift vectors, pressure zones, and turbulence visualization
5. **Free Camera Mode**: Select "Free" camera view and use mouse to orbit around the aircraft

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React 18.2** - UI framework
- **TypeScript 5.2** - Type safety
- **Three.js 0.160** - 3D graphics library
- **React Three Fiber 8.15** - React renderer for Three.js
- **@react-three/drei 9.92** - Useful helpers for R3F
- **Zustand 4.4** - State management
- **Tailwind CSS 3.3** - Styling
- **Vite 5.0** - Build tool and dev server

## 📝 Notes

- The simulation uses simplified aerodynamics for visual purposes and is not intended for scientific accuracy
- Particle count can be adjusted in `AirflowParticles.tsx` (default: 5,000)
- Performance may vary based on hardware; reduce particle count if needed
- The application requires WebGL support in your browser

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Peer Dependency Warnings (ERESOLVE)

If you encounter `npm WARN ERESOLVE overriding peer dependency` warnings during installation, this is typically harmless and won't affect functionality. However, if you want to suppress these warnings:

1. **Option 1**: Use the legacy peer deps flag:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. **Option 2**: Enable it in `.npmrc` by uncommenting the `legacy-peer-deps=true` line

3. **Option 3**: Update all packages to their latest compatible versions (already done in this project)

The warnings occur because some packages have peer dependency requirements that may conflict with other packages. The application will still work correctly despite these warnings.
